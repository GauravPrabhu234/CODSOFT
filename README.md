Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

We leverage several Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data. NumPy is used for numerical operations, while Pandas facilitates data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for creating insightful visualizations to understand the data better.
